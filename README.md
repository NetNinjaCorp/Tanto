### 📐 The Art of Policy Crafting
Every ninja needs a template. Here's how we structure our scrolls of wisdom:
```jsonCopy{
  "policyName": "Corporate Browser Settings",
  "description": "Standard browser configuration for corporate environment",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "createdDate": "2024-10-26T00:00:00Z",
  "modifiedDate": "2024-10-26T00:00:00Z",
  "author": "NetNinja Admin",
  
  "configuration": {
    "homePage": {
      "name": "HomePage",
      "description": "Corporate homepage URL",
      "defaultValue": "https://internal.company.com",
      "dataType": "string",
      "required": true,
      "validationRegex": "^https?:\\/\\/.*$"
    },
    "searchProvider": {
      "name": "SearchProvider",
      "description": "Default search provider URL",
      "defaultValue": "https://search.company.com/search?q={searchTerms}",
      "dataType": "string",
      "required": true
    }
  },

  "policies": [
    {
      "name": "Configure Edge Homepage",
      "description": "Sets the default homepage for Edge browser",
      "category": "Applications",
      "requiresReboot": false,
      "targetOSVersion": "Windows 10+",
      "requiredConfigurations": ["homePage"],
      "settings": [
        {
          "settingType": "Registry",
          "sequence": 1,
          "required": true,
          "hive": "HKLM",
          "keyPath": "SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Main",
          "valueName": "HomepageLocation",
          "valueType": "REG_SZ",
          "value": "${homePage}",
          "operation": "Create"
        },
        {
          "settingType": "Registry",
          "sequence": 2,
          "required": true,
          "hive": "HKLM",
          "keyPath": "SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Main",
          "valueName": "HomepageIsNewTabPage",
          "valueType": "REG_DWORD",
          "value": 0,
          "operation": "Create"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
### 🎋 Policy Application
When deploying policies to devices, an application manifest specifies which policies to apply and their configurations:
```jsonCopy{
  "policies": [
    {
      "policyUrl": "https://policies.company.com/browser-settings",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "configurationValues": {
        "homePage": "https://intranet.company.com",
        "searchProvider": "https://search.company.com/search?q={searchTerms}"
      },
      "enabledPolicyItems": [
        "Configure Edge Homepage",
        "Configure Search Provider"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
